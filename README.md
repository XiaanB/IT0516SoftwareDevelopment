This is a collection of the work that i have done while studying Python.
I have followed the course structure and supplemented it with an Udemy course, by Tim Bulchaka
Both my assignments has also been added to the repository.
Module 2 Python basics contains most of the work. I enjoyed loops, lists and the functions the
most.
Most of the work with lists, loops, functions and classes are in the assignment folder.
ALl the extras has been put in the test folder.

All the programs and excercises have comments in them to explain the program and what it does.

Most of the comments were added afterwords. It was only later in the course, mostly in assignment 2
that I discovered how important teh comments were, especially as I work shift work and had to leave my
coding for a couple of days and come back to. It saved me a lot of time trying to figure out what I was thinking
when I coded a certain part and to make sense of it. This is certanly once of the most valuable things
that I have learned. To comment as you go. It takes a little bit of extra time on the spot but saves lots of
time later on.

I thought that I started assignment 2 to early and that the course has not covered all that was needed for
the assignment at that stage, but I learned so much by trail and error and by googleing it. The mistakes that
I made won't be repeated and it helped my understanding of python alot.

I know that there is still a lot to explore in python and I am looking forward to learning more.
