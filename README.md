This is a collection of the work that i have done while studying Python.
I have followed the course structure and supplemented it with an Udemy course, by Tim Bulchaka
Both my assignments has also been added to the repository.
Module 2 Python basics contains most of the work. I enjoyed loops, lists and the functions the
most.
MOst of the work with lists, loops, functions and classes are in the assignment folder.
ALl the extras has been put in the test folder.

All the programs and excercises have comments in them to explain the program and what it does.
